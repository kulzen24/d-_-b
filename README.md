Smile Sound Playlist from Reddit

The -\_-SmileSound-\_- playlist builder uses the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) and spotipy to store the top songs uploaded to major music subreddits on a weekly basis to a set playlist. Any Reddit user who enjoys listening to new songs when they are posted can now have them on the go in their pocket. Any music fan who may not be on Reddit has an additional outlet now to easily listen to crowdsourced music from some of the largest music communities online.

Check out the playlists [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/aj3g1gvb0isomhttkmrknt87c?si=foVGCcE6RCOTMpqYLL7V2A)

Apple Music & Tidal equivalents TBD

Any suggestions to update the code are appreciated and the tool is in beta with many more subreddits to be added in the next few months. All tools used are open-source. For any feedback or questions, please contact kwekuulzen@outlook.com
